# Week 1

# In structor: Aspen Olmsted

In this module, we roll up our sleeves and start coding! We will learn to use both IDLE to develop code and also to compile code from the command line. The Python scripts can be written on a Windows, Mac OS or Linux machine and I will show you how to do so. Our first programs will focus on reading input from the keyboard and outputting the results of the program to the console output.

# Learning Objectives
* Develop scripts that read user input from the keyboard
* Develop scripts that output information to the console
* Compile and run Python Programs in IDLE
* Compile and run Python Programs in Visual Studio Code
